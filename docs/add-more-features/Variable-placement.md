# Variable placement

Our chabot has more functionality now, we want to make it more lit by powering it with more user conversion experience. Imagine our Pizza bot asked a username and about what they will have as toppings. we can use the response to give a good message that describes to a user what they expect to be in the delivery package.

## More on variable placement

Lets have a look at the `order_pizza` flow below:-

![Pizza flow example](/img/pizza-example-flow.png)

From  the flow above, we can use user's response from previous state to provide a personalized response. Variable placement is implemented in the flow by enclosing state name in double curl brackets as `{{state name}}`. The same format is used Sarufi Dashboard. The variable should be only used within the same flow.

## Get working

We are going to update our pizza bot to provide personalized answers. Below are yaml and json files. After updating flow file, go ahead to update your bot as we did in previous guides.

Below is how the variable placement works:

![Pizza flow with variable placement illustration](/img/variable-placement-illustration.png)

User response from previous state is stored in memory of the next state. So at state `username`, a bot has a memory of response provided in previous state of `order_pizza` with a value __Jovine__. The value can be referenced in the message as `{{username}}`.

This can be done at any state in the same flow. The bot will let our customer know how many pizzas has ordered and kind of toppings. This is a cool experience with our bot now.

Lets get started by updating our flow file. Feel free to use the dashboard as the flow is the same

At `order_pizza` state, our customer will provide the number of pizzas, this response is stored in memory of the next state. So at state `number_of_pizzas`, a bot has a memory of response provided in previous state of `order_pizza`.

The same happens at `pizza_toppings` state; where the response from previous state, `number _of_pizzas` is in the memory at that state.

This can be done at any state in the same flow. The bot will let our customer know how many pizzas has ordered and kind of toppings. This is a cool experience with our bot now.

In the flow used you can notice presence of choices. If you find it hard to understand, please refer to [chatbot addons: choices](/docs/getting-started/chatbots-addons#handling-choices) guide.

## See the outcomes

Below is what the bot response looks like. The bot uses the flows shared above.

You can see how this feature can be used to provide personalized experience to your customers.
